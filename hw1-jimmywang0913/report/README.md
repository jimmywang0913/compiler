## How much time did you spend on this project

about 2 days.

## Project overview

Describe the project structure and how you implemented it.
I start from the easy part like key word or symbols first. Those took me about 3 hours to finish the rules.
After i reach the avidance case, i realized all rules need to add <INITIAL> state in front of it enable to control them.
That part takes a lots of time. 
Some other problems like logical things or lex language, I had cross all of them. 
oh! when I was doing the comment part, I figure out how hard it could be without state to use.
  
## What is the hardest you think in this project

The comment part is the hardest I think. 
oh, and the token function takes a little bit of time to understand.

## Feedback to T.A.s

README file is quite clear. It helps a lot, really. (thumbs up)
